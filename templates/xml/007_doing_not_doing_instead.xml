            <h3>Doing / Not Doing Instead</h3>
            <p>We all do things that can run counter to, oppose, or hinder our goals. What specifically are you doing or not doing instead of taking steps to reach your Improvement Goal?</p>
            <blockquote>Example: Fred is an aspiring novelist. His goal is to "get better at integrating creative writing into my daily life" but something he does instead is "I surf the internet when I have sat down to write." Something he does not do instead is "I don't schedule writing time into my week."</blockquote>
